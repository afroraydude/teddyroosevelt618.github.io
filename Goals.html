                        <a id="fp"><h2>Foreign Policy</h2></a>
                        <p>
  <span class="font1">"Speak softly and carry a big stick"</span>, meaning that you should always try to negotiate peacefully first, but if that doesn’t work, on the other hand you should have the threat of military. There once was a man who popularized this in his presidency. That is the candidate we endorse fully for the 2016 election. Vote TR today to use his policy to try to stop armed conflicts in Colombia, Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq, Ukraine and Russia.
</p>

  <a id="j"><h2>Jobs</h2></a>
  <p>Teddy Roosevelt enacted the square deal with the intention of doing three things: control of corporations, consumer protection and conservation of natural resources. Now what about today? Everyone wants to, or does, work a high paying job. They want their children to not grow up in poverty and they want their children to be able to work a high paying job when they grow up as well. Vote for Teddy Roosevelt to create jobs for the future of America and bring down unemployment and homelessness rates.

<a id="c"><h2>Conservation</h2></a>
                        
                        <p>No one wants to live in a country where there is no reason to go outside because there is no outside. The age of only using technology is fast approaching and when it does there will be no more beautiful outside to look at. We must protect the natural resources of the slowly-diminishing earth.
</p><figure class="left marg_right1"><img src="images/page1_img1.jpg" alt=""></figure>

<a id="d"><h2>Drugs</h2></a>
<p>
  Medical marijuana significantly reduces amount of seizures and recreational marijuana will reduce the marijuana smuggling crimes and other marijuana-related crimes. Just as prohibition did not work during the 1920’s, a prohibition on marijuana will work even less. Vote TR for a lower crime rate and a better future for your kids and the sick kids in the hospital.  
</p>
</p><figure class="left marg_right1"><img src="images/page1_img1.jpg" alt=""></figure>
<a id="t"><h2>Trust-Busting</h2></a>
<p>
  Major corporations today like Google and Amazon are basically owning everything, which decreases competition and innovation. Without competition, the company’s can charge more and not have as many discounts and deals. Therefore you don’t get the deal you deserve. Get money back in your wallet. Vote TR today to Bust the Trusts.
</p>
<figure class="left marg_right1"><img src="images/page1_img1.jpg" alt=""></figure>
<a id="r"><h2>Racism</h2></a>
<p>
  People are racist everyday even though racism is not good and all races are equal in every way. This is what started the civil war. Over whether people should be allowed to keep Africans as slaves, property and not actual people. Everyone should be nice to another race just like Teddy Roosevelt did with Booker T. Washington while segregation was still law. Vote Teddy Roosevelt for less racism in the world.
