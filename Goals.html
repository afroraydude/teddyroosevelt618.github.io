                        <h2>Foreign Policy</h2>
                        <p>
  <span class="font1">"Speak softly and carry a big stick"</span>, meaning that you should always try to negotiate peacefully first, but if that doesnâ€™t work, on the other hand you should have the threat of military. There once was a man who popularized this in his presidency. That is the candidate we endorse fully for the 2016 election. Vote TR today to use his policy to try to stop armed conflicts in Colombia, Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq, Ukraine and Russia.
</p>

  <figure class="left marg_right1"><img src="images/page1_img1.jpg" alt=""></figure><h2>Jobs</h2><p>Teddy Roosevelt enacted the square deal with the intention of doing three things: control of corporations, consumer protection and conservation of natural resources. Now what about today. Everyone wants, or does, work a high paying job. They want their children to not grow up in poverty and they want their children to be able to work a high paying job when they grow up as well. Vote for Teddy Roosevelt to create jobs for the future of America and bring down unemployment and homelessness rates.

<h2>Conservation</h2>
                        
                        <p>No one wants to live in a country where there is no reason to go outside because there is no outside. The age of only using technology is fast approaching and when it does there will be no more beautiful outside to look at. We must protect the natural resources of the slowly-diminishing earth.
</p><figure class="left marg_right1"><img src="images/page1_img1.jpg" alt=""></figure>

<h2>Racism</h2>
<p>
  People are racist everyday even though racism is not good and all races are equal in every way. This is what started the civil war. Over whether people should be allowed to keep Africans as slaves, property and not actual people. Everyone should be nice to another race just like Teddy Roosevelt did with Booker T. Washington while segregation was still law. Vote Teddy Roosevelt for less racism in the world.
