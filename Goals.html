  <span class="font1">"Speak softly and carry a big stick"</span>
, meaning that you should always negotiate peacefully first, but if that doesn’t work should have the threat of a military. There once was a man who popularized this in his presidency. This man is the candidate we endorse fully for the 2016 election. Vote Teddy Roosevelt today to use his policy to stop armed conflicts in Colombia, Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Ukraine and Russia.

  <a id="j"><h2>Jobs</h2></a>
  <p>
    Teddy Roosevelt enacted the square deal with the intention of doing three things: control of major  corporations, consumer protection, and conservation of natural resources. Now what about today? Everyone wants to, or does, work a high paying job. Every parent wants their child to grow up and live in a happy and healthy home with a high paying job. No one ever wants or expects their child to live in poverty but it is happening every day. Vote for Teddy Roosevelt to create jobs for the future of America.

<a id="c"><h2>Conservation</h2></a>
                        
                        <p>
                          No one wants to live in a world where you have to wear an oxygen mask outside because there are no  trees left to make the very air we breathe. The age where technology is the very core of our lives is fast approaching and when it does there will be no more of Mother Earth to enjoy.  We must protect the natural resources and the only sane way of life of our slowly-diminishing, life giving earth.

<a id="d"><h2>Legalizing Cannabis</h2></a>
<p>
  Medical marijuana significantly reduces amount of seizures and recreational marijuana will reduce the marijuana smuggling crimes and other marijuana-related crimes. Just as prohibition did not work during the 1920’s, a prohibition on marijuana will work even less. Vote TR for a lower crime rate and a better future for your kids and the sick kids in the hospital.

</p><figure class="left marg_right1"><img src="images/trustbusting.jpeg" alt=""></figure>
<a id="t"><h2>Bust The Trusts</h2></a>
<p>
  Major corporations. When you hear those words you will no doubt think of Walmart, Google, and McDonalds. Large corporations are murdering small business which reduces competition and innovation to dust. Without competition, the companies can charge more so small businesses have to reduce their prices to almost nothing in order to compete. Not to mention that low income families can barely get by as it is. Teddy Roosevelt’s goal is to change all of that. Vote Teddy Roosevelt today to bust the trusts.

<a id="r"><h2>Combating Racism</h2></a>
<p>
  People are racist to others everyday, even though all races are equal in every way. This is what started the civil war. We fought over whether people should be allowed to keep Africans as slaves, property and not actual people. Mr. Roosevelt promoted equality, no matter what race anyone was. Vote Teddy Roosevelt for less racism in the world.
